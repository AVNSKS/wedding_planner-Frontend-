## 📖 Overview

**WedVow** is not just a wedding planner; it is a **high-intent data platform**. It solves the coordination chaos between couples spending money and vendors providing services.

Unlike standard to-do lists, WedVow features a **dual-interface architecture**:
1.  **For Couples (Rose Theme):** An emotional, romantic interface for planning, budgeting, and guest management.
2.  **For Vendors (Teal Theme):** A professional, data-dense CRM for tracking revenue, bookings, and leads.
